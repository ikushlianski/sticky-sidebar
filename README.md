I was asked to build a sticky sidebar for Yandex advertizing for Stolichnoe Televidenie website (ctv.by).

It shows ads on every article page. I was tasked with building this sidebar so that if its contents are less than the height of the screen, then the content becomes sticky.

When reaching the end of the article, the contents should stick to the bottom of the container until the user scrolls up and they are again in the view.
